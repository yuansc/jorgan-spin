/**
 * Implementation of a dispatcher which uses a pool of modal dialogs to dispatch
 * events. The dialogs are concealed, i.e. they are located outside of the visible
 * screen area. 
 * <br>
 * Note that the <code>Dispatcher</code>s created by this class are not usable
 * for GUIs with <code>Cancel</code> functionality since they will block
 * user access to all windows of your application during dispatching.<br>
 * While this seems to be a major drawback this class nevertheless has its
 * eligibility:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     It shows that <em>Spin</em> does no 'magic' nor any dirty tricks - 
 *     every shown <code>Dialog</code> does the same. 
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     If your application really needs a <code>Cancel</code> functionality
 *     you should consider to use a  real asynchronous solution as showed in
 *     <code>spin.demo.async.AsyncGUI</code> - please see also the caveat
 *     <a href="../../../index.html#asynchronous">'asynchronous'</a>. 
 *   </li>
