      <p>
        Swing is the standard component architecture for developing Java desktop applications. Its exhaustive collection of widgets is the foundation for easy development of rich graphical user interfaces (GUI).<br />
        Alas every non trivial <acronym title="Graphical user interface">GUI</acronym> sooner or later encounters the problem of "freeze". This annoying behaviour is experienced by users every time the application performs extensive calculations or blocks for network or disk I/O.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will explain the reason for this <a href="problem.html">problem</a> and explore different techniques to prevent Swing <acronym title="Graphical user interface">GUI</acronym>s from "freezing". We will present our project named <em>Spin</em> which offers a - to our knowledge - revolutionary new approach. It offers a solution for transparent thread handling with minimal impact on your application code.
